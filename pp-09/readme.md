# Production Problem 09: Usability Checklists

## The Problem

Usability checklists are typical, and sometimes mindless, tools/magic tricks used to find usability problems in web and other digital projects. What you are going to do for this Production Problem is to locate at least 2 different usability checklists of at least 25 items (use Google, but challenge yourself to go beyond the first page of results). From those lists, create your own, condensed list of exactly ten items. Share with your group for Project 3 to help yourselves create your own master usability checklist.

## Deliverables

* Your own condensed, ten-item must-have usability checklist:

1.	Research: do research about competitors, collect data about existing products and take user feedback.
2.	Plan: draw a user story and plan out red routes.
3.	Explore (ideas): brainstorm, sketch ideas and build prototypes if possible.
4.	Communication: this is where titles, navigation (as mentioned in part #7 and #8) become crucial because it is important to organize your content in a clear and consistent way. Make sure to use the user's language too. Make the product accessible.
5.	Create: Build the actual website (product) taking into account color theory, typeface and other UI elements. Make sure the website is responsive.
6.	Give feedback: prevent error by giving users a warning, give them a loader while the page is loading and when something works out, let the users know.
7.	Test: Have the user test out your website. Observe the user and fix.
8.	Titles: Using appropriately sized typeface for readability.  
9.	Navigation: This helps the user know where they are at on the website and how to get back.
10.	Findability: content is easy to scan and read, uses keywords to respect SEO (Search Engine Optimization) guidelines.
