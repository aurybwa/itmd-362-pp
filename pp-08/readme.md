# Production Problem 08: Emotional Design Hunt

## The Problem

First, read the assigned reading from Donald Norman, listed on the ITMD 362 syllabus.

Then, locate a physical object that you use regularly in your life (does not have to be an electronic or digital object), take a photograph of it, and identify in a sentence or two its visceral, behavioral, and reflective levels of emotional design. Then, develop a list of three qualities in that objectâ€™s emotional design that your group might use in your MyIIT redesign project. Be sure to share these with your group.

## Deliverables

A. Photograph of the object (place in the pp-09/ directory and commit).

B. Emotional design levels of your object: a Stabilo pen

* Visceral: The pen by itself is not particularly aesthetically pleasing. It is neutral and simple in its design (it almost looks like a stick). Thus, it is not likely to create any reaction. However, it usually comes in a pack with other pens of different color. And I think that is where the appeal of this product lies. How so? Well, the pack of pens looks like a rainbow and rainbows are usually associated with happiness and other such feelings.

* Behavioral: When one begins using the pen, one quicky realize how efficient the pen is. Its cap is not difficult to take on and off. Its long and thin aspect makes it easier for users to grab it. The pointy tip is perfect for writing and sketching.

* Reflective: I really had to think about this part. Surprisingly, my favorite part about using this pen is that whatever color the cap has on is what comes out on paper. So, this instills a feeling of trust within the users.

C.  Emotional design qualities of the object that might be useful for Project 2 MyIIT redesign:

1. Simple: it's not too intricate and people can easily pick up on its usability.
2. Functional: It does one thing and does it really well.
3. Trustworthy: It does what it claims to do.
