# Production Problem 07: Implementing HCI guidelines for touchscreens

## The Problem

Using the HCI guidelines from either Apple/iOS, GNOME, or Windows, redesign the login page at
http://my.iit.edu/ for a touch-friendly environment. Use this to kickstart your work on Project 2.

**You only need to sketch your redesign**, and in the text below, reference at least three different
points of guidance from chosen HCI guidelines that went into your redesign sketches (you might
want to do multiple sketches, each highlighting a different feature of the same overall design).

## Resources

* Apple iOS HCI Guidlines:
  https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/overview/design-principles/
* Gnome Desktop:
  https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/design
* Windows Desktop Guidelines:
  https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/design

## Deliverables

Small commits to your Production Problems repository that include:

1) photographs of sketches of your new design, from your sketchbook
2) an explanation of three different points of guidance from your chosen guidelines (point to the
   specific URL where the guidance can be found) that you implemented in your sketch, written below:

* HCI Guidline One (URL): Branding: https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/visual-design/branding/
* How you implemented it in your sketch: I would implement branding by using Illinois Tech's logo along with the typeface (Futura) the school uses to brand itself. It would not take much space (unobtrusive) and refined, which is what Apple's iOS HCI guidelines recommend.

* HCI Guidline Two (URL): Layout: https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/visual-design/layout/
* How you implemented it in your sketch: I decided an unobtrusive layout with large spacing between elements. One of the guidlines for layout was to use visual weight and balance to convey importance. So, the username and password fields along with the login button take a bit more space on the page to be highlighted.

* HCI Guidline Three (URL): UI Bars: https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/ui-controls/edit-menus/
* How you implemented it in your sketch: I added a vertical UI Bar that slides in from the left-hand side. The UI Bar can be invoked in an out of the page by clicking on an icon (three-horizontal bar to open and the x to close). The thought behind using the UI Bar is to declutter the log in page and take out information that the user do not necessarily need to see.
